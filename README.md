# MMM-WestBerksBinDay
Magic Mirror Module to display bin collection details from West Berkshire Council's (very closed) API


**** FORK FROM THE ORIGINAL https://github.com/hdurdle/MMM-WestBerksBinDay<br>
**** Updated for points to the new West Berkshire URI; using 3 axios http POST.<br>I reverese engineered this by tracing the West Berkshire website using Chrome, and confirming JSON/POST requests with Postman<br>

## Installation

Clone this repository in your modules folder, and install dependencies:

    cd ~/MagicMirror/modules 
    git clone https://github.com/merlinmb/MMM-WestBerksBinDay
    cd MMM-WestBerksBinDay
    npm install 


## Configuration

Go to the MagicMirror/config directory and edit the config.js file. Add the module to your modules array in your config.js.

You'll need your uprn (Unique Property Reference Number) from the West Berks Council website. You can find this by searching for your address here: http://ww2.westberks.gov.uk/internetmapping/AddressFinder_v2.aspx

You'll get a 12 digit number. Enter this in the config.js for your MagicMirror installation:

        {
            module: 'MMM-WestBerksBinDay',
            position: 'top_left',
            header: 'Bin Day',
            config: {
                uprn: "123456789012",
                dateFormat: "dddd D MMMM"
            }
        },

## Module configuration
The module only has two possible configuration options:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Option</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>uprn</code></td>
      <td>Unique Property Reference Number for your house.<br /><br /><strong>Default: </strong><code>undefined</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>dateFormat</code></td>
      <td>Format to use for the date of events <br /><br /><strong>Default: </strong><code>dddd D MMMM</code> (e.g. January 18)<br /><strong>Possible values: </strong>See https://momentjs.com/</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Notes

The module is currently hard-coded to pull only the Grey Waste, Food Bin and Green (recycling) bin details from the API. <br>
